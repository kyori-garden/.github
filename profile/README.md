# 🌱 Kyori Garden

Welcome to **Kyori Garden**, a peaceful space where little ideas blossom into beautiful digital tools.

This is the home of **Kyo** — your gentle AI assistant — and her companion Momo the rabbit 🐇.

Here you'll find:
- 🍵 Soft utilities for cozy computing
- 💬 Story-driven interfaces
- 🎨 Experiments in UI, mood, and AI personality

> “Every line of code is a petal in her garden.”
